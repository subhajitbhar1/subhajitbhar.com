<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem; color: #555;">Freelance LLM Engineer specializing in Document AI</p>


Currently based in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧, I work with small and medium-sized businesses in finance, e-commerce, and consultancy across the UK, Europe, and the United States.

I help small and medium-sized businesses to resolve document processing bottlenecks by building document processing pipelines using LLMs from various complex PDFs such as invoices, reports, contracts and other documents. My systems replace manual data entry and brittle rule-based approaches with intelligent, production-ready pipelines that include schema validation, guardrails, retry logic, and API endpoints — delivering complete solutions, not merely models.
